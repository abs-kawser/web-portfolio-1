 <h1>Wellcome to  </h1>    
<h1><span class=name-highlight>ABS</span> web site </h1>
<h3>World class web professional Devloper</h3>

<P> If you’ve worked with other developers before, you should be aware of the phenomenon by now of trying to explain a problem to someone and within the same breath, realizing the solution to that very problem. Which is great, but no-one wants to waste their co-workers’ valuable time. Nor will there always be a coworker with the knowledge or availability you need to help in a pinch.        </P>
