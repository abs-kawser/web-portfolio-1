    <h3>World class web professional Devloper</h3>
    
    <P> If you’ve worked with other developers before, you should be aware of the phenomenon by now of trying to explain a problem to someone and within the same breath, realizing the solution to that very problem. Which is great, but no-one wants to waste their co-workers’ valuable time. Nor will there always be a coworker with the knowledge or availability you need to help in a pinch.   </P>
